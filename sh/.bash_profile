# .bashrc is read automatically by non-login shells, but most terminal clients
# (including iTerm2 and tmux) launch bash as a login shell, so we need to
# manually source it here.
#
# An example of a non-login shell is if you type "bash" into a bash prompt and
# hit enter. The "inner", or "child" process will not be a login shell, and
# thus it will read .bashrc directly while skipping this file.
source ~/.bashrc

# when using PuTTY on Windows 7 to connect to my Macbook Air, vim complains
# that the Â¬ character is an invalid argument to the 'listchars' option if
# its 'encoding' is 'latin-1', but setting this environment variable causes
# vim to use 'utf-8' as the value of 'encoding', which fixes the issue.
# I'm not sure why this doesn't happen when sshing from PuTTY... it probably
# has to do with the env set by local login shells vs. those created by the
# ssh daemon.
#
# it seems like this affects a lot of other shell utilities as well, including
# git: running 'git diff' before checking in this change results in <C2><AC>
# instead of the nbsp character, but running 'LANG=en_US.utf-8 git diff' shows
# the correct output.
